# Painting!!!

### I first found my love for painting in High School Art class. My Mother that I did not know very well was also a painter. I paint by picture, which means I look at a photograph and then paint it. I'm not much of a freestyle artist. I also enjoy the painting classes that are popular in the states where you meet at a bar and paint in a group setting!

#Photography

### I Received my first real camera in December of 2016 as a Christmas gift from my Husband Ian. Ever since that day I have been taking photos with it and even have taken a college course to learn more about photography! I love capturing memories that can last a lifetime!
